cgi_app -- Framework for reusable web applications

### WARNING

This is very old code. I wrote it originally in 2004 and haven't
developed it since then. It is not a modern web framework. There are
probably better options available. I put this up on github partly as a
historical curiosity and partly because, for better or worse, people
still use this code.
